        <p id="p1">In the repeated rock-scissor-paper (RPS) game, players accumulate knowledge about their opponent's playing strategies over many back-to-back games, and advantages are gained and lost as each player tries to outsmart the other.  This experiment seeks to understand if, and how quickly, players can gain an advantage against opponents playing RPS according to a simple rule unknown to the player.
