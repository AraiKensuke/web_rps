        <p id="p1">In the repeated rock-scissor-paper (RPS) game, multiple matches are played back-to-back, and you'll be at an advantage if you can predict your opponent's next move, while keeping yourself unpredictable.  Repated RPS is probably played in a constant cat-and-mouse state, where small advantages are gained and lost by each player every few matches.  The following experiment seeks to understand if, and how quickly, players can gain an advantage against opponents playing RPS according to a simple rule unknown to the player.
