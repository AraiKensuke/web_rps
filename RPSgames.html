    <H1>Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Experiments!</H1>
    Can you figure out how to beat a machine playing repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors?  This is a study on how people compete and strategize against each other by using artificial intelligence to stand in for opponent.  Playing against intelligent machines allows us to study competition in a controlled and repeat setting, and also let's you compare your playing against others who played against the exactthe same alogirthms.  We have several versions of this experiment, played against different types of intelligence.

   <A href="TournamentRules.php">vs Fixed rules of play.</A>  Here, you'll play against a machine that plays using a fixed set of rules to decide what to hand to play next.  If you're observant, you can figure out how to win!

   <A href="javascript:alert('Coming soon, mid-July or so.');">vs An adaptive AI RPS machine.</A>  This machine learns how YOU play over successive games, so you'll have to figure out how to outsmart this machine, if you want to win.
