    <H1>Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Experiments!</H1>
    Can you figure out how to beat a machine playing repeated Rock-Paper-Scissors?  This is a study on how people compete and strategize against each other by using artificial intelligence to stand in for one of the opponents.  Playing against intelligent machines allows us to study competition in a controlled and repeatable setting.  It also let's you compare your playing against others who played against the exactthe same alogirthms.  We have several versions of this experiment, played against different types of intelligence.

   <A href="TournamentRules1.php"><FONT style="font-size:18pt;">vs Machine that doesn't learn.</FONT></A>  Here, you'll play against machines, each playing using a static, fixed set of rules to decide what to hand to play next.  Each machine is different, and if you're observant, you can figure out how to win against each of them!

   <A href="TournamentRules2.php"><FONT style="font-size:18pt;">vs Machine that does learn.</FONT></A>  This machine is adaptive, meaning it learns more about how you play with each successive game, and uses this against you.  How do you think you can defeat this machine?  Are you up for the challenge?
